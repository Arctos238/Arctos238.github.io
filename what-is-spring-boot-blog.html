                Have you ever found Java to require so much work to setup a
                simple application? Wouldn’t it be nice to have a preconfigured
                way to build a Java Application quickly and bring Java back to
                the modern standard of development? What if I told you there was
                solution, Spring Boot.
              </p>
              <p>
                This popular Java framework allows for building and deploying
                web application quickly. This framework is a sub framework of
                Spring. This doesn’t mean that Spring Boot is a competitor for
                Spring but a tool within the Spring technology.

              <h2 class="section-heading">Wait a second, REST what?</h2>
              <p>
                REST API or RESTful Web Service is probably one of the best
                technologies we can use to connect backend applications to
                frontend applications like React, Angular for example. So, what
                is REST? Representational State Transfer (REST) is an
                architecture design for sending data. It allows us to create
                endpoints on the web to send data from one application to
                another application via JSON (JavaScript Object Notation).
              </p>
              <p>
                You may asking why is this so revolutionizing and why do I hear
                about it everywhere? Well imagine you have an application,
                written in Java (Can be written in any language), that controls
                the persistence and retrieval of data from a database. Then you
                have a React Application (Written in JavaScript/JSX) that
                display information on the web. Now they are both written in two
                completely different languages, how can we connect them
                together?
              </p>
              <p>
                The answer is REST APIs. Not only can you retrieve the data, but
                it allows you to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
                operations on that data, allowing Java and JavaScript to
                communicate to one another through HTTP requests.
              </p>
              <img

              />
              <span class="caption text-muted">RESTful API Architecture</span>
              <p>
                Here is how of how a REST API works, the REST API web server
                will host four HTTP request and allows the Web Application to
                send one of four requests:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>GET – Obtains the information from the database.</li>
                <li>POST – Save the information to the database.</li>
                <li>PUT – Update the information to the database.</li>
                <li>DELETE – Delete the information from the database.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Theses requests receive and send JSON objects through the REST
                API. The backend application will then convert the JSON from a
                POJO (Plain Old Java Object), if using Java for instance, or to
                a POJO to allow the REST application to perform a CRUD operation
                based on the request sent.

                ><img

              /></a>
              <p>
                Spring is a popular framework for building Java applications.
                This framework is amazing as it can be used to build many types
                of applications including, MVC (Model View Controller) full
                stack websites, RESTful API’s, Hibernate Persistence (Proprietor
                version of JPA), Spring Messaging (Message based applications).
              </p>
              <p>
                Spring is a combinations of libraries (JAR files) which have
                done all the heavy lifting for us and only require us the write
                boiler plate and the configuration. Its very easy to setup with
                a project, as all you need to do is includes these JAR files
                into the project’s build path.
              </p>
              <p>
                So why use Spring over standard Java? Well Java has no
                structure, you are free to build an application in any way you
                want, which sounds great but when it comes to collaborating
                other developers, and not having theses guidelines that Spring
                offers, can often lead confusion about the code they wrote. This
                is one useful reason to use Spring, because it has libraries
                already made and ready to use, all you need to do is follow
                their guidelines for the configurations. This makes building
                projects quick and easy for everybody.
              </p>
              <p>
                The other great thing is because everyone is following theses
                guidelines it makes the code more maintainable and easier for
                other developers working on the project in the future.
              </p>

              class="img-fluid mt-2"
              src="assets/img/spring-controller-code.png"
              alt="Spring Controller Class Code By Jacque Pointer"
            />
            <span class="caption text-muted">Spring Controller Class</span>
            <img

            alt="Java Controller Class Code By Jacque Pointer"
          />
          <span class="caption text-muted">Java Servlet Class</span>
              <p>
                Examining both Java classes above for mapping HTTP requests to
                your web application, you can tell by looking at the Servlet
                Class (Standard Java) that this code is a lot harder to memorize
                versus the Spring Controller Class (Spring's version of a
                Servlet). There is no need to extend classes or Override
                Methods, simply just use the @ notations provided by Spring and
                let it do all the work for you.
              </p>
              <p>
                Although Spring is great, it does come with some downsides one
                of them being the amount of configuration needed is tedious and
                very prone to human error. Another thing is the need to use a
                separate web server to run the Web Applications which is also
                another thing to configurate. Lucky for us, this is where Spring
                Boot comes in.
